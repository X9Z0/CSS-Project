# Photo Editing Frontend Design

## Introduction

This project is a result of my journey to master CSS and HTML, particularly in the context of React development. As I delved into React, I realized that my struggles with CSS were hindering my progress. To overcome this obstacle, I decided to dedicate time to learning CSS thoroughly. The best way, I thought, was to build a project from scratch.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a frontend design using CSS and HTML. It's important to note that the design is not responsive. The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of key concepts like BEM (Block Element Modifier), Flexbox, and Media Queries.

## Features

- **BEM Methodology:** The project adheres to the BEM methodology, helping maintain a modular and scalable code structure.

- **Flexbox Layout:** Utilizing Flexbox for creating flexible and efficient layouts, making it easier to handle complex designs.
